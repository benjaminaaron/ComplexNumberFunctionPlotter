# ComplexNumberFunctionPlotter
An experiment in plotting complex number functions (4D).

Just the basic setup so far, nothing working just yet. The plan is to implement two ways of plotting functions involving complex numbers:
- two parallel planes in 3D, one of which represents the input value(s) of the function and the other one represents the outcome value, the line from one to the other will be drawn and the expectation is that a bunch of these lines will look interesting... or totally messy, will see
- a 3D plot in which the missing dimension (which can be switched between the four: real part of the input value, imaginary part of the input value and the same two for the outcome value) is encoded into the color of the point at the 3D-location
