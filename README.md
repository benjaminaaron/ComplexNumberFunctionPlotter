# ComplexNumberFunctionPlotter
An experiment in plotting complex number functions in 'pseudo-4D'.

The plan is to implement two ways of plotting functions involving complex numbers:
- [done] two parallel planes in 3D, one of which represents the input value(s) of the function and the other one represents the outcome value, the line from one to the other will be drawn and coloring can represent factor between lenght or something else
- a 3D plot in which the missing dimension (which can be switched between the four: real part of the input value, imaginary part of the input value and the same two for the outcome value) is encoded into the color of the point at the 3D-location. propably using a lot of little planes between, one on top of four 'needles' (rising from the input plane) each.
